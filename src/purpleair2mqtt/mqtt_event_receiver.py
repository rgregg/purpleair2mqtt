This module defines the MqttEventReceiver class, which is responsible for receiving and processing MQTT messages.
It connects to an MQTT broker, subscribes to a specified topic, and processes incoming messages using the 
FrigateEventProcessor class. The module also handles publishing messages to the MQTT broker and provides an 
interactive command-line interface for managing ongoing events.
Classes:
    MqttEventReceiver: A class that handles MQTT message reception, processing, and publishing.
Functions:
    on_message: Callback when the client receives a message from the server.
    on_connect: Callback when the client connects to the server.
    on_disconnect: Callback when the client disconnects from the server.
    publish_message: Publishes a message to the MQTT broker.
    connect_and_loop: Connects to the MQTT broker and starts the event loop.
